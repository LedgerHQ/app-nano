# ledger-app-nano

Nano ($XNO) wallet application for Ledger Nano S, Ledger Nano S+, and Ledger Blue devices.

## For users

Install the Nano app from the Ledger Live device manager. See Ledger's [guide on installing apps](https://support.ledger.com/article/4404382258961-zd).

Interacting with the Nano network requires wallet software with integrated Ledger support.

_If a wallet should be added to this list, please [create an issue](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-nano/issues/new)._

## For developers

Browser-based wallets can integrate Ledger device support using the [hw-app-nano](https://github.com/roosmaa/hw-app-nano/) JavaScript library built using [LedgerJS](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs).

Wallets of any type can interact with the device directly using the binary protocol detailed in the [APDU documentation](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-nano/blob/master/doc/nano.md).
